THIS PROJECT IMPLEMENTS A CLASSIC SNAKE GAME USING THE SFML LIBRARY IN C++. IT FEATURES A MOVING SNAKE THAT GROWS IN LENGTH UPON EATING FOOD, INTEGRATES SOUND EFFECTS, HANDLES USER INPUTS THROUGH KEYBOARD EVENTS, AND MANAGES GAME STATES INCLUDING COLLISIONS AND SCORE TRACKING. THE GAME WINDOW IS GRAPHICALLY RENDERED USING SFML/GRAPHICS.HPP, WHILE AUDIO EFFECTS ARE PLAYED USING SFML/AUDIO.HPP.

THE GAME INITIALIZES A WINDOW OF SIZE 800×600 PIXELS AND RENDERS A GREEN SNAKE INSIDE IT. THE PLAYER CAN CONTROL THE MOVEMENT OF THE SNAKE USING THE ARROW KEYS (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EAT AS MANY RED FOOD BLOCKS AS POSSIBLE, WHICH ARE RANDOMLY SPAWNED ON THE GRID. EACH TIME THE SNAKE EATS A FOOD BLOCK, IT GROWS IN LENGTH AND PLAYS A SOUND EFFECT (EAT.WAV). THE GAME ENDS IF THE SNAKE COLLIDES WITH THE WINDOW BORDERS OR WITH ITSELF.

THE CODE IS ORGANIZED AROUND TWO PRIMARY STRUCTS AND ONE MAIN CLASS. THE STRUCT SNAKE HOLDS A VECTOR OF POSITIONS REPRESENTING THE SNAKE’S BODY SEGMENTS AND A DIRECTION VECTOR TO TRACK THE CURRENT MOVEMENT DIRECTION. THE STRUCT FOOD SIMPLY CONTAINS A POSITION VECTOR THAT INDICATES WHERE THE FOOD IS PLACED ON THE GAME GRID. THE MAIN CLASS, SNAKE_GAME, CONTAINS THE CORE GAME LOGIC AND GRAPHICAL FUNCTIONS. IT INCLUDES A METHOD TO GENERATE FOOD AT RANDOM LOCATIONS THAT DO NOT OVERLAP WITH THE SNAKE’S BODY, ENSURING FAIR PLAY. THE UPDATE SNAKE METHOD HANDLES THE MOVEMENT OF THE SNAKE, CHECKING FOR COLLISIONS WITH FOOD TO INCREASE THE SCORE AND PLAY A SOUND EFFECT. IT ALSO CHECKS FOR COLLISIONS WITH THE WINDOW BOUNDARIES OR THE SNAKE ITSELF, WHICH RESULTS IN A GAME OVER MESSAGE AND THE CLOSURE OF THE GAME WINDOW.
THE DRAW GAME METHOD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RENDERING THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME TO THE WINDOW, DRAWING THE SNAKE AS GREEN BLOCKS AND THE FOOD AS A RED BLOCK. THE METHOD USES SFML’S RECTANGLE SHAPE OBJECTS FOR VISUAL REPRESENTATION. THE CLASS ALSO INCLUDES A HANDLE INPUT METHOD THAT LISTENS FOR KEYBOARD EVENTS TO CHANGE THE SNAKE’S DIRECTION, WHILE PREVENTING THE SNAKE FROM MOVING DIRECTLY BACKWARD INTO ITSELF.

THE AUDIO FEATURE INTEGRATES A SOUND FILE NAMED EAT.WAV, WHICH MUST BE PRESENT IN THE EXECUTION DIRECTORY. THIS SOUND IS LOADED INTO A SOUND BUFFER AND PLAYED VIA A SOUND OBJECT EACH TIME THE SNAKE EATS FOOD, PROVIDING AN AUDIBLE INDICATION OF SUCCESSFUL CONSUMPTION. IF THE SOUND FILE FAILS TO LOAD, THE PROGRAM WILL PRINT AN ERROR AND TERMINATE TO AVOID RUNNING WITHOUT THE NECESSARY AUDIO ASSET.

THE GAME LOOP CONTINUOUSLY PROCESSES INPUT EVENTS, UPDATES THE GAME STATE, AND RENDERS THE UPDATED GRAPHICS AT A FIXED FRAME RATE OF 10 FRAMES PER SECOND. THIS LOOP HANDLES WINDOW EVENTS SUCH AS KEY PRESSES AND WINDOW CLOSURE, UPDATES THE SNAKE’S POSITION BASED ON THE CURRENT DIRECTION, CHECKS FOR COLLISIONS, AND DRAWS THE SNAKE AND FOOD EACH FRAME. THE SCORE IS UPDATED IN REAL TIME AND DISPLAYED IN THE CONSOLE WHEN THE GAME ENDS.

TO COMPILE THIS PROGRAM, USERS SHOULD ENSURE THEY HAVE THE SFML LIBRARY INSTALLED AND LINK THE NECESSARY SFML MODULES (GRAPHICS, WINDOW, SYSTEM, AUDIO) WHEN COMPILING WITH A C++20 COMPILER LIKE G++. THE SOUND FILE EAT.WAV MUST BE AVAILABLE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE SOURCE CODE OR EXECUTABLE TO ENSURE THE SOUND EFFECT PLAYS CORRECTLY.
IN SUMMARY, THIS PROJECT SHOWCASES HOW TO DEVELOP A COMPLETE 2D SNAKE GAME USING OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN C++ COMBINED WITH MULTIMEDIA CAPABILITIES PROVIDED BY SFML. IT PROVIDES A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF EVENT HANDLING, RENDERING, COLLISION DETECTION, AND AUDIO INTEGRATION. THIS CODE CAN BE EXTENDED TO ADD FEATURES SUCH AS SCORE DISPLAY IN THE WINDOW, PAUSE/RESTART FUNCTIONALITY, OR INCREASED DIFFICULTY LEVELS, MAKING IT A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR BEGINNER TO INTERMEDIATE GAME DEVELOPMENT IN C++.
